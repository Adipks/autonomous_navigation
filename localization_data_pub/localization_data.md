> This folder contains the files for localisation of the rover that works for even dynamic environments.


> The logic uses Extended Kalman Filer that takes in the Visual Odometry Data from the ZED-2i Stereo camera, Odometry from wheel encoders, IMU from ZED-2i camera, and the Initial Pose and helps AMCL localise the Footprint of the rover more precisely by filtering out the Noise from various sensors and fusing them together.
