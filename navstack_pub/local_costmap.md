<h1>Time Elastic Band - Local Planner</h1>


Time Elastic Band (TEB) is a dynamic local planner used in robotic navigation, especially for systems that need to account for the robot's dynamics and optimize
paths in real time. TEB stands out because it creates flexible, optimized trajectories in both space and time. This makes it especially useful for robots that have
non-holonomic constraints (such as car-like robots) and require obstacle avoidance, smooth motion, and responsiveness to dynamic environments.
